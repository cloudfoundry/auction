This repository contains the source code for the Cloud Foundry package
responsible for the details behind Diego's scheduling mechanism.

> \[!NOTE\]
>
> This repository should be imported as `code.cloudfoundry.org/auction`.

There are two components in Diego that participate in auctions:

-   **The Auctioneer** is responsible for holding auctions whenever a
    Task or LongRunningProcess needs to be scheduled. The Auctioneers
    run on the Diego "Brain" nodes, and there is only ever one active
    Auctioneer at a time (determined by acquiring a lock in Locket). The
    Auctioneer communicates with Reps on all Cells when holding an
    auction.
-   **The Rep** represents a Diego Cell in the auction by making bids
    and, if picked as the winner, running the Task or
    LongRunningProcess. There is one Rep running on every Diego Cell.
